The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [June 9, Thursday, 2022].

## Log

### R1D1 
Finally got done with the technical documentation project from freecodecamp. You can check the [preview here](https://kushyzee.github.io/Bootstrap-technical-documentation-project/). This is the [link to the repository](https://github.com/kushyzee/Bootstrap-technical-documentation-project/commits/main)

### R1D2
- I spent a lot of time learning about git and how to integrate it with vscode. I successfully learnt it after following tutorials on YouTube and I did a test run by commiting some dummy files to github through vscode

- I continued my responsive layout journey on freecodecamp. Right now I am learning about CSS variables by building a city skyline.

### R1D3
-  I finally completed the CSS variable chapter on freecodecamp by building a city skyline. I also started working on a new project where I am trying to clone [tello website](https://trello.com/home)

### R1D4
- I didn't do much today except working on the website cloning project I started yesterday. I got stuck trying to make a full page navigation menu and after several hours of searching for ways to do it with just HTML and CSS online, I found a great video on YouTube by Prem Shahi [codinglab channel](https://youtu.be/nKnrdABs7Zs) which was very useful

### R1D5
- I didn't have access to my laptop for most part of today, so I used my phone to work on a little project using the knowledge of a video tutorial I watched on YouTube a few days ago. It's a simple full page nav menu using just HTML and CSS

### R1D6 
- I completed the CSS grid exercise on freeCodeCamp's New responsive web design curriculum. Up next is the certification project where I am required to build a landing page while sticking to the laid down guidelines

### R1D7
- Started working on my landing page certification project today. I quickly built a template using the guidelines specified by @freeCodeCamp to make sure I passed all the test, so right now I will build the page around the template I created.

### R1D8
- Today I started writing out the HTML for the landing page project by freecodecamp, it's a page for a car rental service

### R1D9
I made a major breakthrough today while trying to create a collapsible sidebar. I was stuck for a while but I was able to figure it out later on

- [Github repository](https://github.com/kushyzee/zee-rentals-landing-page)

### R1D10
Continued working on the car rental landing page. I am considering setting the nav menu as a top nav bar instead of putting it on the left
