 # 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 9, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed FreeCodeCamp technical documentation project

**Thoughts**: It was a fun project where I had to learn a lot about CSS, specifically about positioning because that's the aspect that gave me a hard time on this project

**Link(s) to work**:
