 # 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 9, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed FreeCodeCamp technical documentation project

**Thoughts**: It was a fun project where I had to learn a lot about CSS, specifically about positioning because that's the aspect that gave me a hard time on this project

### Day 2: June 10, 2022

**Today's Progress**: learnt a little bit about git and also started a new journey on my responsive design certification course in freecodecamp

**Thoughts**:
- I spent a lot of time learning about git and how to integrate it with vscode. I successfully learnt it after following tutorials on YouTube and I did a test run by commiting some dummy files to github through vscode

- I continued my responsive layout journey on freecodecamp. Right now I am learning about CSS variables by building a city skyline
