### Day 4: June 12, 2022

**Today's Progress**: continued working on cloning Tello website

**Thoughts**: I didn't do much today except working on the website cloning project I started yesterday. I got stuck trying to make a a full page navigation menu and after several hours of searching for ways to do it with just HTML and CSS online, I found a great video on YouTube by Prem Shahi [codinglab channel](https://youtu.be/nKnrdABs7Zs) which was very useful


### Day 5: June 14, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a simple full page nav menu project

**Thoughts**: I didn't have access to my laptop for most part of today, so I used my phone to work on a little project using the knowledge of a video tutorial I watched on YouTube a few days ago. It's a simple full page nav menu using just HTML and CSS

### Day 7: June 16, 2022

**Today's progress**: Started my landing page certification project

**Thoughts**: Started working on my landing page certification project today. I quickly built a template using the guidelines specified by freeCodeCamp to make sure I passed all the test, so right now I will build the page around the template I created. After some minutes of thinking about the type of landing page I want to do, I finally settled on creating one for a rental car service (zee rental). I already made some sketches of the layout and various components, next will be to put them all together

### Day 23: July 4. 2022

**Today's progress**: Took Harvard's CS50 course

**Thoughts**: Now that i am done with freecodecamp's responsive web design course, I fully focused on the introduction to computer science (CS50) course by Harvard. I learnt about the different kinds of loop in C language which are For loop, Do-while loop and the while loop (infinite loop)

### Day 24: July 6. 2022

**Today's progress**: Worked on a coding exercise using C

**Thoughts**: I started working on Harvard CS50 problem set one which is done using the c language. I couldn't figure out how to solve the problem correctly and I had to research about it online and finally figured it out

### Day 25: July 7. 2022

**Today's progress**: Finally completed CS50 problem set 1

**Thoughts**: Aftering tinkering with the problem today, I finally worked it out and successfully passed all the test. I have submitted it and move on to the next problem 

### Day 26: July 8. 2022

**Today's progress**: watched a tutorial on building a website from scratch

**Thoughts**: I have been sick for about two days but I am slowly getting better. I couldn't do any coding yesterday as well as today but I watched a tutorial video by Kevin Powell on how he approach building a website from start to finish 

### Day 27: July 12. 2022

**Today's progress**: Learnt about data types in C

**Thoughts**: I am still not completely recovered from my illness and I can't really do much coding without getting stressed out. I learnt about data types today and how they are used in C (integers, characters, strings, floats, etc)

### Day 28: July 13. 2022

**Today's progress**: Started the next exercise in CS50 problem set one

**Thoughts**: I started the second exercise in the problem set one of Harvard's CS50 and I am working on a problem called greedy algorithm. I am almost done with it and will finish it up tomorrow.

### Day 29: July 14. 2022

**Today's progress**: Learnt about arrays

**Thoughts**: I continued with the CS50 course today and I learnt about arrays and how they are used in C programming. I finished the week 2 and got started with problem set 2 which looks like it's going to be quite stressful 

### Day 30: July 15. 2022

**Today's progress**: Learnt about functions 

**Thoughts**: I created my first function today after taking a short lesson on it. A test problem was given at the end of the lecture to see if what has been taught about declaring and defining functions was understood and I successfully passed the test

### Day 31: July 17. 2022

**Today's progress**: Continued CS50 course 

**Thoughts**: I didn't do much today aside from continuing with the #CS50 course. I was supposed to start problem set 2 today but I just decide to leave it for tomorrow and I used the rest of today to revise what I've learnt the previous week (arrays, variable scope)

### Day 32: July 19. 2022

**Today's progress**: completed problem set 2

**Thoughts**: I completed the first set of problem set 2 of Harvard's CS50 course. I enjoyed working on this problem and I thought I was beginning to get really good at C programming but the next problem set was more difficult as I thought and isn't as much fun. I have made good progress on it though and I will complete it tomorrow 

### Day 33: July 20. 2022

**Today's progress**: Learnt about recursions

**Thoughts**: I had a hard time understanding recursions after watching the CS50 lecture video about it so I did some research about it and I found a really good YouTube channel that explained it very well and I have understood a lot about recursions, far better than what I got from CS50 

### Day 34: July 22. 2022

**Today's progress**: completed CS50 lab 3 problem set

**Thoughts**: I worked on CS50 lab 3 problem which involved figuring out which sorting algorithm is used for several .txt files that contained thousands of numbers. I accomplished this by comparing the run times of some of the files

### Day 35: July 23. 2022

**Today's progress**: solved a fibonnaci series problem

**Thoughts**: I was able to solve a fibonnaci series problem using a iteration approach the previous day, so today i tried to solve the same problem making using of functions as well as the recursive method and i was able to solve the problem using those two appoach. so in essence, i was able to solve the fibonnaci problem using 3 different approaches

### Day 36: July 26. 2022

**Today's progress**: Started working on CS50 problem set 3

**Thoughts**: I finished the plurality election problem set yesterday and today i have started working on the runoff election problem which i have gotten halfway through, i will have to complete it tomorrow

### Day 37: July 27. 2022

**Today's progress**: Did a lot of debugging

**Thoughts**: it is funny how i always spend more time debugging my codes than actually writing them. I have written most of the codes for the cs50 problem i started yesterday but i noticed they weren't working the way i planned, so i spent several hours figuring out what went wrong and fixing them.

### Day 38: July 28. 2022

**Today's progress**: Finally completed CS50 problem set 3

**Thoughts**: After several days of working on the runoff election problem, I finally finished it today. I learnt a lot of things while working on the problem and I understood some concepts much better

### Day 39: July 30. 2022

**Today's progress**: Started working on CS50 lab 4

**Thoughts**: My task for this lab is to implement some functions that alters the volume of an audio file and stores the altered audio in another file. i have already written one of the functions, it's remaining one more.

### Day 40: July 31. 2022

**Today's progress**: Started working on CS50 problem set 4 (filters)


**Thoughts**:This problem looks like it will be very tought to crack. my task is to create four functions that applies a filter to images (grayscale, sepia, reflection, blur). I already created the grayscale function, up next is sepia

### Day 41: August 1. 2022

**Today's progress**: Continued working on CS50 problem set 4

**Thoughts**: I easily wrote the sepia filter function today and I also didn't have much difficutly writing the function for reflecting an image but the last function which is blur is very difficult

### Day 42: August 3. 2022

**Today's progress**: Completed CS50 problem set 4

**Thoughts**: After several days, I was finally able to complete this problem set. It was a very challenging problem but I am glad to have successfully completed. Writing the codes for the first two filters (grayscale and sepia) wasn't so difficult but the 3rd filter (reflection) was a bit difficult while the last one (blur) was the toughest

### Day 43: August 5. 2022

**Today's progress**: wrote some pseudocodes

**Thoughts**: I started working on a new problem set from Harvard and I wrote the pseudocodes for it. I am not yet done coz I haven't fully understood the problem 

### Day 44: August 6. 2022

**Today's progress**: completed CS50 problem set 5

**Thoughts**: This problem was much easier than I thought and everything became easier after I wrote the pseudocode and broke the problem into smaller components 

### Day 45: August 8. 2022

**Today's progress**: learnt about asymptotic analysis

**Thoughts**: I was supposed to continue with CS50 course today but I decided to just read up on this week's topic before watching the video for week 5, so I went to YouTube and watched the data structure course videos from neso academy 

### Day 46: August 9. 2022

**Today's progress**: Started week 5 of CS50

**Thoughts**: I learnt about linked lists and how to create them in C programming using structs. I still don't fully understand the whole thing, so I plan on making more research on YouTube 

### Day 47: August 11. 2022

**Today's progress**: Built a simple calculator

**Thoughts**: I didn't have access to my laptop today, so I used my phone to create a simple calculator program in C programming. It does simple arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division 

### Day 48: August 12. 2022

**Today's progress**: Started working on Harvard's CS50 lab 5 project 

**Thoughts**: I still haven't fully understand the project, but at least I know about some of the things I am to do. I will have to go through the guidelines again to try figure out how to do the tasks given in the project 

### Day 49: August 13. 2022

**Today's progress**: Went through some source codes from CS50

**Thoughts**: I started working on a lab 5 problem yesterday and up till now I still can't figure out how to start it.I had to go through the source codes that were used during the class to understand how hash tables and tries work.

### Day 50: August 15. 2022

**Today's progress**: Completed CS50 Lab 5 project

**Thoughts**: I finally completed the Lab 5 problem which turned out to be easier than I thought. I was supposed to start problem set 5 but GitHub codespaces refused to connect throughout today so I took that opportunity to go start working on the very first project Harvard gave in the week one lecture which I have been postponing 

### Day 51: August 16. 2022

**Today's progress**: Started building a simple game

**Thoughts**: I spent time building a simple traffic crossing game which is my project for the very first CS50 problem set. I still have a lots of features to add to the game and it will probably take me the rest of this week to complete it

### Day 52: August 18. 2022

**Today's progress**: Did some challenges on codewars

**Thoughts**: I signed up on codewars today and did some kata. It was fun and it helped me strengthen my knowledge of C language but I'm stuck on the next kata. I will come back to it later on after taking a break

### Day 53: August 20. 2022

**Today's progress**: Started a frontend mentors challenge 

**Thoughts**: It has been some months since I did any project using HTML and CSS, so I started working on a coding challenge by frontendmentors. I have made good progress and should get it completed tomorrow 

### Day 54: August 21. 2022

**Today's progress**: solved some problems on codewars and hackerrank

**Thoughts**: i have been trying to solve a particular problem on codewars for over 2 days but i ran into a bug that i couldn't figure out, so today i signed up on hackerrank. I went back to the codewars problem later on and i finally figured out what was wrong with the code

### Day 55: August 22. 2022

**Today's progress**: Completed a frontend mentor challenge

**Thoughts**: It has been about 2 months since i did any web development using html and css, so today i took up one of the challenges from frontend mentor and solved it.

### Day 57: August 24. 2022

**Today's progress**: finally completed the game 

**Thoughts**: After spending hours fine tuning the game, adjusting the difficulty and adding sound effrcts, I finally completed it. I haven't finalized it and prepare to submit to Harvard because there's a high chance I will still improve some of its features later on but for now I am done with it and started working on the problem set 5

### Day 58: August 25. 2022

**Today's progress**: Made significant progress on CS50 problem set 5
