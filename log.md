 # 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 9, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed FreeCodeCamp technical documentation project

**Thoughts**: It was a fun project where I had to learn a lot about CSS, specifically about positioning because that's the aspect that gave me a hard time on this project

**Link(s) to work**:
- [Technical documentation project](https://kushyzee.github.io/Bootstrap-technical-documentation-project/)
- [project commits on github](https://github.com/kushyzee/Bootstrap-technical-documentation-project/commits/main)


### Day 2: June 10, 2022

**Today's Progress**: learnt a little bit about git and also started a new journey on my responsive design certification course in freecodecamp

**Thoughts**:
- I spent a lot of time learning about git and how to integrate it with vscode. I successfully learnt it after following tutorials on YouTube and I did a test run by commiting some dummy files to github through vscode

- I continued my responsive layout journey on freecodecamp. Right now I am learning about CSS variables by building a city skyline

### Day 3: June 11, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I finally completed the CSS variable chapter on freecodecamp by building a city skyline. I also started working a new project where I am trying to clone [tello website](https://trello.com/home)

### Day 4: June 12, 2022

**Today's Progress**: continued working on cloning Tello website

**Thoughts**: I didn't do much today except working on the website cloning project I started yesterday. I got stuck trying to make a a full page navigation menu and after several hours of searching for ways to do it with just HTML and CSS online, I found a great video on YouTube by Prem Shahi [codinglab channel](https://youtu.be/nKnrdABs7Zs) which was very useful


### Day 5: June 14, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a simple full page nav menu project

**Thoughts**: I didn't have access to my laptop for most part of today, so I used my phone to work on a little project using the knowledge of a video tutorial I watched on YouTube a few days ago. It's a simple full page nav menu using just HTML and CSS
